      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>[Do you own a cellphone? a computer or a car? Did you know that any modern technology carries precious metals and minerals? 
          More than one-half of all the components in a mobile device are made from mine and semi-processed materials. 
          My job is to make sure mining companies find those materials in the subsurface through my expertise in geophysical methods. 
          I want my website to promote my research in geoscience and professional experience. 
          I want to share my passion for what I do and I would love to grow my connections. ]</p>  <!-- change this -->


      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p>[During the most restrictive part of the pandemic, networking was very limited to only social media. This affected me career tremendously. 
          I had recently graduated with a masters degree and it was very difficult to make contacts that could point me in the right direction. 
          However, I also realized that having a website is a good place to direct people when they want to know more about you and it creates more networking opportunities.
           My ideal audience are anyone that lands in my page. They are professionals or students in my field that may have professional advices or future projects where I could included. ]</p>  <!-- change this -->
