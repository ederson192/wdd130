    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <h3>Purpose</h3>
    <p>Rafting has been part of my life since I was a little child. My dad used to take my family to camping every summer. It was rafting the activity that always 
      got the best out of us. We worked as a team trying to row and mantining equilibrium as the fast current pull us down the river. We always ended up wet but we
      laughed so much. We enjoyed each other. This website is a tool to share rafting, and how this activity can help you family grow together as much as it did for mine.

    <h3>Audience</h3>
    <p> I would love to reach families and single people. I see families searching for fun activities during summer break. I picture them tired of COVID-19, looking for an activity
      that would relax them and connect them as a family. This website will offer them with rafting, a wholesome activity for a family looking for a distraction during summer. 
      They will access to my website through their desktop computer. </p>

You should have at least 2 colors but do not have to fill in all 4 if you do not need them.  -->
